# Examples

Small scripts, one per common task. Each one is a complete `index.ts` you can read from top to bottom and adapt.

| Example | What it shows |
|---|---|
| [create-zugferd-with-own-pdf](create-zugferd-with-own-pdf/index.ts) | Create a ZUGFeRD invoice that keeps your own PDF layout, passed as a public URL (`pdfUrl`). |
| [create-cii-and-embed](create-cii-and-embed/index.ts) | Build a CII XML from your invoice data with `createCii`, then embed it into a PDF you already have with `embedZugferd`. |
| [email-zugferd](email-zugferd/index.ts) | Create a ZUGFeRD invoice and email it from your own verified domain in one call. |
| [email-embedded-zugferd](email-embedded-zugferd/index.ts) | Build a CII XML from your invoice data, then embed it into a PDF you already have and email the ZUGFeRD invoice with `emailEmbeddedZugferd`. |
| [validate-invoices](validate-invoices/index.ts) | Validate a ZUGFeRD PDF and an XRechnung XML, print every finding, and save the printable validation report. |
| [render-xml-to-pdf](render-xml-to-pdf/index.ts) | Turn any invoice XML (XRechnung, CII or UBL) into a readable PDF. |
| [convert-ubl-to-zugferd](convert-ubl-to-zugferd/index.ts) | Convert a UBL invoice XML into a ZUGFeRD invoice. |
| [transform-to-zugferd](transform-to-zugferd/index.ts) | Turn an ordinary PDF invoice into a ZUGFeRD invoice. AI reads the PDF, so a person checks the result. |
| [parse-pdf-invoice](parse-pdf-invoice/index.ts) | Read an ordinary PDF invoice, typed, scanned or photographed, into the invoice model with AI, and see how sure the read was per area. |
| [extract-json-and-attachments](extract-json-and-attachments/index.ts) | Read a received ZUGFeRD invoice as a typed `InvoiceDocument` and save its embedded attachments as a ZIP. |

## Run an example

1. Open the example's `index.ts` and replace the values at the top: `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key, and the file paths or URLs with your own. An example whose file is missing tells you which value to change.
2. Build the library once, then run the example from the repository root. Node.js 22.18 or later runs the TypeScript file directly; on older versions use a TypeScript runner such as `npx tsx`.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node examples/create-cii-and-embed/index.ts
```

The examples use the library source in this repository: inside the repository, `@invoicexml/zugferd-xrechnung` resolves to the package itself, built from `src`, and `npm run typecheck` checks the examples against `src`. To use one in your own project, copy its `index.ts` and install the package instead. The import stays the same:

```bash
npm install @invoicexml/zugferd-xrechnung
```
